This was my first ever project with React. The main aim of this freeCodeCamp challenge was to start using the React state management.

Seeing the markdown text render instantly in my little app felt like magic!

I also improved on the challenge's base request by including a light and a dark mode with a switch button (again, React state management). Next improvement? Detect the system's light/dark mode selection and automatically apply the same setting.
